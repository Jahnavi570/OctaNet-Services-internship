**Features**
Transaction History: View a log of all transactions performed.
Withdraw: Withdraw money from the account.
Deposit: Deposit money into the account.
Transfer: Transfer money to another account.
PIN Verification: Secure PIN verification system for user authentication.

Replace password = 1234 in the code with your actual ATM PIN for testing purposes.
Ensure that all interactions with the ATM simulation are carefully reviewed and tested in a safe environment before use with real financial accounts.
